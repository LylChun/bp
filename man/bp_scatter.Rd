\usage{
bp_scatter(
  data,
  plot_type = c("stages2020", "AHA"),
  subj = NULL,
  group_var = NULL,
  wrap_var = NULL,
  inc_crisis = TRUE,
  inc_low = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A processed dataframe resulting from the \code{process_data} function that
contains the \code{VISIT} (potentially, depending whether or not that information is
available), \code{SBP}, and \code{DBP} columns.}

\item{plot_type}{String corresponding to the particular type of plot to be displayed. Default
plot (\code{"stages2020"}) sets the BP stages according to Lee et al (2020) with 8 mutually
exclusive categories. The option to include or exclude either a "Low" or "Crisis" category are
determined through the \code{inc_low} or \code{inc_crisis} function arguments, respectively.
Setting \code{plot_type = "AHA"} will use the deprecated plot according to the guidelines
set forth by the American Heart Association

(reference: \url{https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings})}

\item{subj}{Optional argument. Allows the user to specify and subset specific subjects
from the \code{ID} column of the supplied data set. The \code{subj} argument can be a single
value or a vector of elements. The input type should be character, but the function will
comply with integers so long as they are all present in the \code{ID} column of the data.}

\item{group_var}{A categorical column of the input data set that the individual points are to
be grouped / separated by for a given plot. Cannot contain more than 10 levels (to avoid
overcrowding the plot). This is different from the \code{wrap_var} argument which segments
plots by category.}

\item{wrap_var}{A categorical column of the input data set that the plots are to be segmented
by. If there are multiple levels such as time of day, or visit #, the output will include a
matrix with each plot corresponding to an individual level. This differs from the \code{group_var}
argument which separates data within the same plot.}

\item{inc_crisis}{A TRUE / FALSE indicator of whether or not to include the Hypertensive "Crisis"
category to the scatter plot. The range for crisis is any value above 180 for SBP or above 120 for
DBP.}

\item{inc_low}{A TRUE / FALSE indicator of whether or not to include the "Low" (Hypotension)
category to the scatter plot. The range for Hypotension is set from a minimum of 25 for DBP or 80
for SBP, or the corresponding minimum value for either category from the data until 60 for DBP and
100 for SBP.}

\value{

points) onto a background that contains each stage

\description{
The \code{bp_scatter} function serves to display all \code{SBP} and \code{DBP}
readings on a scatterplot based on which stage each recording lies, according to the 8
mutually exclusive levels of Hypertension set forth by Lee et al (2020). However, original
levels set by the American Heart Association (AHA) are also available for plotting for
legacy purposes. There are eight total stages according to Lee et al (2020) with the options
to include an additional category for "Low" (Hypotension) and Hypertensive "Crisis". The
categories are as follows:

\itemize{

\item \code{Low} - While low readings do not necessarily imply Hypotension, they are worth being
alert for. According to the AHA, low blood pressure is any \code{SBP} reading below 100 or
\code{DBP} reading below 60 and is depicted in light blue in the scatter plot. This is indicated
on the plot by setting \code{inc_low = TRUE}

\item \code{Normal} - (Optional) Consistent \code{SBP} readings less than 120 and \code{DBP} readings
less than 80. This is the ideal stage where blood pressure is to be maintained at.
Normal BP is depicted in green in the scatter plot.

\item \code{Elevated} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings between 120 - 129 and \code{DBP}
readings less than 80. Without intervention to control the condition, individuals are
likely to develop Hypertension. Elevated BP is depicted in yellow in the scatter plot.

\item \code{Stage 1 - All (SDH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings between 130 - 139 and \code{DBP}
readings between 80 - 89. Stage 1 Hypertension will typically result in doctors prescribing
medication or lifestyle changes. Stage 1 BP is depicted in dark orange in the scatter plot.

\item \code{Stage 1 - Isolated Diastolic Hypertension (IDH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings
less than 130, but \code{DBP} readings between 80 - 89. This alternative stage 1 level accounts
for unusually high diastolic readings, but fairly normal systolic readings and is depicted in
orange in the plot.

\item \code{Stage 1 - Isolated Systolic Hypertension (ISH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings
between 130 - 139, but \code{DBP} readings less than 80. This alternative stage 1 level accounts
for unusually high systolic readings, but fairly normal diastolic readings and is depicted in
orange in the plot.

\item \code{Stage 2 - All (SDH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings between 140 - 180 and \code{DBP} readings
between 90 - 120. Stage 2 Hypertension will typically result in doctors prescribing both
medication and lifestyle changes. Stage 2 BP is depicted in bright red in the scatter plot.

\item \code{Stage 2 - Isolated Diastolic Hypertension (IDH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings
less than or equal to 140, but \code{DBP} readings greater than or equal to 90. This alternative
stage 2 level accounts for unusually high diastolic readings, but fairly normal systolic readings
and is depicted in red.

\item \code{Stage 2 - Isolated Systolic Hypertension (IDH)} - Consistent \code{SBP} readings
greater than or equal to 140, but \code{DBP} readings less or equal to 90. This alternative
stage 2 level accounts for unusually high systolic readings, but fairly normal diastolic readings
and is depicted in red.

\item \code{Crisis} - (Optional) A Hypertensive crisis is defined as a \code{SBP} reading exceeding 180 or a
\code{DBP} reading exceeding 120. This stage requires medical attention immediately.
Crisis is depicted in red in the scatter plot.
